                        <a id = "link" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html"><super>Python</super></a> is a general purpose, high level programming language. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
                        One of the best qualities of Python is its consistency. After working with Python for a while, you are able to start making informed, correct guesses about features that are new to you. 
                    <p>However, if you learned another object oriented language before Python, you may have
                        found it strange to spell len(collection) instead of collection.len() . This apparent
                        oddity is the tip of an iceberg which, when properly understood, is the key to everything
                        we call Pythonic. The iceberg is called the Python Data Model, and it describes the API
                        that you can use to make your own objects play well with the most idiomatic language
                        features.
                    
                        You can think of the Data Model as a description of Python as a framework. It formalizes
                        the interfaces of the building blocks of the language itself, such as sequences, iterators,
                        functions, classes, context managers and so on.

                    <p>
                        I/n the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application based work in December of 1989 by at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in Netherland. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had the interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did as really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features.

                    <p>
                        It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language which had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.

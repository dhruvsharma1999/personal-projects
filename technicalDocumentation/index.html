                        <a id = "link" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html"><super>Python</super></a> is a general purpose, high level programming language. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
                        One of the best qualities of Python is its consistency. After working with Python for a while, you are able to start making informed, correct guesses about features that are new to you. 
                    <p>However, if you learned another object oriented language before Python, you may have
                        found it strange to spell len(collection) instead of collection.len() . This apparent
                        oddity is the tip of an iceberg which, when properly understood, is the key to everything
                        we call Pythonic. The iceberg is called the Python Data Model, and it describes the API
                        that you can use to make your own objects play well with the most idiomatic language
                        features.
                    
                        You can think of the Data Model as a description of Python as a framework. It formalizes
                        the interfaces of the building blocks of the language itself, such as sequences, iterators,
                        functions, classes, context managers and so on.

                    <p>
                        I/n the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application based work in December of 1989 by at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in Netherland. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had the interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did as really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features.

                    <p>
                        It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language which had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.

                        <h2>1: Automating your daily routine tasks</h2>
                        Python can be used to automate the routine, tedious tasks that consume your time on a daily basis. With Python, you can make your everyday life easier.

                        Tasks that can be automated with Python:
                        Searching files in the database or text in files
                        Updating, creating and renaming the folders and files according to your requirement.
                        Searching the web and creating dictionaries
                        Sending message notifications and reminder emails
                        Tracking and sorting invoices

                        Automating these tasks only requires you to write a few lines of code. Python is a simple and easy language that doesn’t require you to do a lot of coding.
                        <h2>2. Automatically detects what’s in the image</h2>
                        Detecting faces from a huge loop of images comes under Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology. Before delving into how Python automatically detects the image, let’s understand why Python is popular among AI and ML scientists.

                        <h3>Why Python is popular for artificial intelligence and machine learning</h3>
                        Python is a popular language for artificial intelligence and machine learning. AI and ML areas involve the gathering, analyzing and processing of a huge amount of data on a daily basis. Most AI and ML professionals look for the language that can be easy to learn and understand, as any complex programming language can increase the learning curve for AI and ML scientists, leading to a delay in the project development. So, they mostly prefer the Python language. Python syntax resembles the everyday English language, meaning AI and ML scientists can work with complex systems easily.

                        Other features that make Python a perfect choice for AI and ML projects are:

                        It offers flexibility
                        It has a huge community support (a bunch of resources and documentation are available that enable you to build amazing products)
                        It is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any platform, including Windows, Linus, macOS, Unix and many more.
                        How can you make your device recognize images using Python?
                        Python offers you the best and open-source face recognition library for free, known as face-recognition 1.2.3. You can use this library in your Python script and make your device recognize faces in images. With this, you can easily find the pictures of a particular person from a huge number of images. All this coding with Python can be done in just a few hours. Python makes the implementation of AI and ML easy.

                        <h2>3. Data analysis, manipulation and visualization</h2>
                        It is said that humans can perceive things better looking at visual data. Data scientists have the capability to gather a huge amount of unstructured data to analyze and synthesize it into structured visual content. This helps the companies to get actionable insights into their businesses.
